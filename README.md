## 🎯 How It Works

1. Kid calls your Telnyx number
2. Telnyx sends webhook to your Home Assistant
3. HA answers with friendly greeting
4. Story is generated (AI or backup)
5. TTS reads story aloud
6. Asks if they want another (max 3 per call)
7. Says goodnight and hangs up

---

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

- ✅ No authentication required (webhooks work by design)
- ✅ Telnyx validates webhook signatures
- ✅ No personal data stored
- ✅ Call logs local to Home Assistant
- ✅ Stories not saved (generated fresh each time)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Call doesn't connect

1. Check Home Assistant logs: Settings → System → Logs
2. Verify Telnyx API key is correct
3. Test webhook manually:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://YOUR_HA_URL/api/webhook/dial_a_story \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"data":{"event_type":"call.initiated","payload":{"call_control_id":"test","from":"+15551234567"}}}'
   ```

### No greeting plays

- Verify webhook URL in Telnyx matches your HA instance
- Check HA firewall allows inbound HTTPS
- Look for errors in HA logs

### Stories are boring

- Add OpenAI API key for AI-generated stories
- Adjust `story_length` to match kid's attention span
- Edit `STORY_THEMES` in code for custom topics

### Kids lose interest

- Reduce `story_length` to `short`
- Try different `voice_preference`
- Make it part of a bedtime routine

---

## 🔧 Advanced Customization

### Add Your Own Story Themes

Edit `custom_components/dial_a_story/__init__.py` and modify `STORY_THEMES`:

```python
STORY_THEMES = [
    "a friendly dinosaur who loves to share toys",
    "YOUR CUSTOM THEME HERE",
    # ... add more
]
```

### Add Custom Backup Stories

Edit `BACKUP_STORIES` array in the same file.

### Change Voice

Telnyx supports male/female voices. For more options, check [Telnyx TTS docs](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/api/v2/call-control/Call-Commands#CallSpeak).
